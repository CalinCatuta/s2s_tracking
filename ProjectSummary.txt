📌 What We Have Now & What It Does
✅ Current System Summary
You have built a basic Server-to-Server (S2S) tracking system, which is common in affiliate marketing, ad networks, and analytics platforms. Here’s how it works:

1️⃣ User Clicks an Ad (track_click.php)

A user clicks on an ad/link (from a partner or affiliate).
The click_id and offer_id are recorded in the clicks table.
Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Click tracked!"}

2️⃣ User Completes an Action (track_conversion.php)

If the user makes a purchase or registers, the advertiser sends a postback with the click_id.
We check if this click_id exists in the clicks table to prevent fraud.
If valid, we store the conversion in the conversions table.
Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Conversion tracked!"}

3️⃣ Postback is Sent to an Ad Network (sendPostback.php)

Once a conversion is tracked, we notify the ad network (or another system).
The request is sent via cURL to a postback URL (previously a fake endpoint).
This is important because networks reward affiliates based on conversions.

4️⃣ Admin Can Retrieve Reports (get_reports.php)

Using get_reports.php, an admin can check the total clicks and conversions stored.


📌 Why Do We Need Conversions?
Monetization 🤑 – In affiliate marketing, an advertiser pays for valid conversions (not just clicks).
Fraud Prevention 🚫 – You only store real conversions by verifying click_id before inserting.
Tracking Performance 📊 – You can analyze data to see which ads perform best.
